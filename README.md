# AngularJSUsingTypeScript
sample project using Typescript in AngularJS to get in close with ECMA script 6 syntax

AngularJS is a JavaScript Model-View-Whatever (MVW) framework that allows the writing of dynamic Single Page web 
Applications, and is becoming widely embraced because of its simplicity and completeness. Amongst its exhaustive list 
of features, the framework includes Dynamic Data Binding, Client-side Routing, Unit and End2End Testing or even HTML 
language extension.

Typescript, on the other hand, is a typed superset of the JavaScript language that is compiled to produce clean, simple 
cross-browser compatible JavaScript code, which can help when building and maintaining large-scale applications. 
Typescript follows ECMAScript 5 (ES5) syntax but also includes several proposed features of ES6 such as interfaces, 
classes and modules.
